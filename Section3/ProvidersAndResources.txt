Provider Plugins
A provider is a plugin that lets Terraform manage an external API
Terraform init -> Plugins required for the provider are automatically downloaded and saved locally to a .terraform folder

Can specify AWS and Azure in the same Terraform init file

Resources - resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, 
e.g. aws_instance, aws_alb, iam_user, digitalocean_droplet

A resource block declares a resource of a given type ("aws_instance") with a given local name ("myec2")

resource type and name together serve as an identifier for a given resource - must be unique!

You can only use the resource that is supported by a specific provider!

Core concepts, standard syntax remains similar across all providers
